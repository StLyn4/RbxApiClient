## Setting Up the project locally

To install the project you need to have `node` and `yarn`

1.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone
    your fork:

    ```sh
    # Clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RbxApiClient.git

    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd RbxApiClient
    ```

2.  from the root of the project: `yarn install --ignore-scripts` to install all dependencies without executing the postinstall script.

    - make sure you have latest `yarn` version

3.  from the root of the project: `yarn run build` to build the API.

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```sh
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/StLyn4/RbxApiClient.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.
